# ü§ñ Technologies

NestFlux is built on a carefully curated stack of modern, battle-tested technologies that work seamlessly together to provide a robust full-stack development experience.

## üéØ Technology Philosophy

Our technology choices are driven by several core principles:

- **Type Safety First**: TypeScript throughout the entire stack ensures compile-time error detection and superior developer experience
- **Modern Standards**: Leveraging the latest stable versions of frameworks and tools
- **Developer Productivity**: Tools and frameworks that enhance development speed and code quality
- **Performance Optimized**: Technologies chosen for their performance characteristics and optimization capabilities
- **Enterprise Ready**: Production-grade solutions suitable for scalable applications

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

NestFlux employs a **monorepo architecture** with distinct technology stacks for different layers, built on **Node.js 24** ensuring access to the latest runtime features and performance improvements.

### **Client Technologies**
Modern React-based frontend with cutting-edge tooling for optimal user experience and developer productivity.

### **Server Technologies**
Robust NestJS backend leveraging Node.js ecosystem with enterprise-grade patterns and practices.

### **Shared Packages**
Common libraries and utilities that ensure consistency and code reuse across the entire application.

## üîÑ Integration Benefits

The chosen technologies are designed to work together harmoniously:

- **Shared Type Definitions**: Common TypeScript types across client, server, and packages
- **Consistent Tooling**: Unified linting, formatting, and testing approaches
- **Seamless Development**: Hot reload, auto-completion, and intelligent refactoring across the stack
- **Build Optimization**: Coordinated build processes for optimal bundle sizes and performance

Each subsection provides comprehensive details about the specific technologies used, their configuration, and how they integrate within the NestFlux ecosystem.
