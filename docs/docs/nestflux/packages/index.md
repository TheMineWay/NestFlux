# About packages

Packages allow you to share logic and information across projects (even across packages). These packages are not published in the `npm` registry, they are only used within the scope of this monorepo.

All packages are build for `ESM` and `CJS` projects automatically so they can be used in all kind of projects (by default teh client, server and packages).
