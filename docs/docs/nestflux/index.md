# About

NestFlux is a template for apps made with ReactJS and NestJS (written in Typescript). It is meant to speed up the project configuration process by providing a generic solution that ensures type safety, test coverage and a great development experience.

## Custom documentations

This documentation project is meant to contain NestFlux docs and your own project documentation. The NestFlux team ensures no documentations will be added outside the `nestflux` docs directory. This will ensure no conflicts will appear when merging new versions of NestFlux.
