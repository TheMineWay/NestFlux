# File naming conventions

NestFlux provides naming conventions that should be followed to ensure project naming consistency (and sometimes to ensure functionality).

## Basic rules

<ol>
    <li>All file names should be written in **kebab-case**. This prevents GIT issues when working with users that use case insensitive systems. Only markdown files such as README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md are allowed to be written in capital letters.</li>
</ol>

## Table of extensions

Some files contain a custom "extension" before the real extension. For example: get-date.util.ts. This extension helps to identify what kind of file it is without reading its content. Some extensions are project-specific, but generally they are shared across all projects.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan="2">Extension</th>
            <th rowspan="2">Description</th>
            <th colspan="3">Can be used in</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Client</th>
            <th>Server</th>
            <th>Packages</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <ExtensionsTable extensions={NAMING_STRATEGY_EXTENSIONS}/>
    </tbody>
</table>
