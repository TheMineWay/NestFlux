# 💻 Client

The client app is build using React. By itself, it does not enforce any organizational pattern, so we defined some rules that help the project to be organized and scale easily.

## 🌲 Root hierarchy

Explore the root hierarchy. It mainly contains configuration files.

```
client/
├── public/             # Public static files
├── src/                # Project code
├── .env                # Environment file (see template in example.env)
├── .eslintrc.js        # ESLint rules
├── index.html          # HTML entry file
├── package.json        # Project metadata
├── postcss.config.js   # PostCSS config
├── tailwind.config.js  # TailwindCSS config
├── vite.config.js      # Vite configuration file
├── vitest.config.ts    # Vitest configuration file (tests)
└── README.md           # Project info

```

## 👩‍💻 Codebase hierarchy

All the code that builds the project is scoped inside the `src` folder. The folder has its own organization rules. See here its hierarchy.

```
src/
├── app/                # Contains core app files. For example: providers, etc
├── common/             # Contains common (core) features. For example: authentication, etc. It follows the same structure as "features"
├── constants/          # Deprecated. Each feature/common case should contain its own constants
├── features/           # Contains all app features. Here you will do most of changes
├── i18n/               # Contains all internationalization files and utilities
├── routes/             # This is the tanstack router routes folder (https://tanstack.com/router)
├── global.d.ts         # This file contains global types
├── index.pcss          # It is the main styles file
├── main.tsx            # This is the React entrypoint
├── routeTree.gen.ts    # (autogenerated by tanstack router)
└── vite-env.d.ts       # Types for .env
```

## 🎈 Features (and common)

The `features` and `common` folders follow some specific rules. They contain the code that compose the main functionalities of your app.
Each should be formed by folders, each describing the "feature" they represent (for example, "auth" in the common/core/auth). You can nest features inside each other in order to keep them organized in groups.

Each "feature" should contain its code organized in some standard folders (each can have subfolders that better organize each folder):

- **components:** contains React components that compose the UI.
- **lib:** contains all general code utilities (like helpers, etc).
- **constants:** feature specific constants.
- **hooks:** contains React hooks.
- **assets:** contains asset files (like images, spreadsheets, etc).
- **types:** contains TS type definitions.
- **models:** contains TS models (usually as ZOD schemas).
