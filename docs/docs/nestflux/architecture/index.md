# ðŸ‘· Project architecture

This section specifies how the project is and should be organized to keep it legible and easy to understand. You will find rules that will help you organize changes on the codebase.

The repository can contain different types of projects (packages, frontend apps, APIs, etc) and each of them will have some specific rules. You will find specifications for each of them.
